# BAXI
## Introduction
BAXI (currently a prototype) is a mobile application which connects drivers and clients for various transportation services. It provides a simple-to-navigate graphical interface through which clients can place requests for one of four services. These services include BAXI for trips and rides where the client is the passenger, BAXI WOMEN which serves the same purpose but only includes female drivers and riders, BAXI BOX for transportation of light goods, and BAXI BAAR for transportation of heavy cargo. When a service request is placed by a client, drivers who meet the service requirements are notified by the application and are able to accept the request. Upon acceptance, drivers receive the specified coordinates for the pickup and dropoff locations. There is also a rating system through which drivers and clients can rate their experience after each service ends.  
This has been a general overview of BAXI. Our goal is to add many more features and produce a fully functional, clean and complete application. Development is very much a work in progress and many existing features are yet to be tested and verified.
## How To Run
Follow these instructions to run the prototype (running with python3 version 3.10 or higher is advised):
1. Open a terminal and clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the BAXI directory.
3. Run the following command to install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Now navigate to the src directory.
5. There are two panels (applications) that you can run.
	- User panel:
	```bash
	python3 BAXI_MinWindow.py
	```
	- Admin panel:
	```bash
	python3 BAXI_Admin_Employee_MinWindow.py
